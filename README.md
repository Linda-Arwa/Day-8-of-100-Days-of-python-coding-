# Day-8-of-100-Days-of-python-coding-
This repository contains a project for encoding and decoding text in python and also has a program of determining if a number is prime or not.
The encoding and decoding progra is a caesar cipher program. A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. 
Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. 
A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on.
